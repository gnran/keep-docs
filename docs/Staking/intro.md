# Introduction

## Staking KEEP Tokens

The benefit KEEP tokens confer to holders is relative to the amount of stake delegated and therefore to the user’s commitment to the network. The idea is that those with more “skin in the game” reap greater rewards. Get all the details about earning rewards [here](/Staking/rewards.md).

### KEEP Token Dashboard

KEEP token holders can stake their KEEP tokens and earn rewards using the **Keep token dashboard**. It handles everything you’ll need to manage your token grants, staking delegations, and rewards. 

It let’s you: 

* Claim your token grants

* Set up the different roles (authorizer, operator, beneficiary) for staking

* Delegate stake to an operator (staking provider) 

* Track and accept rewards 

Visit the [Token Dashboard section](/Staking/Dashboard/delegate_stake.md) to get started staking your KEEP tokens.

## Ways to Hold KEEP

### KEEP in Token Grants

A **token grant** is an amount of tokens granted to a grantee via unlocking scheme. The tokens can be withdrawn gradually based on the unlocking cliff and the unlocking duration. You’ll be able to delegate both locked and unlocked KEEP to a staking address or a staking provider immediately after receiving your token grant.

Note that tokens that are locked in a token grant will not show up in your wallet, but are available to view in the token dashboard. Once tokens have unlocked and are withdrawn, they will show in your wallet.

### KEEP in a Wallet

You can stake KEEP tokens that you own in the same way that you can stake KEEP tokens that are from a token grant in the token dashboard.
