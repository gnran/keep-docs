# Staking Rewards

The Keep Network has a non-inflationary rewards model, and all rewards are in KEEP, ETH and/or tBTC.

## Overview

KEEP token holders can stake their KEEP tokens and earn rewards using the Keep token dashboard. In the dashboard, there are currently two ways to participate as a staker. You can stake KEEP tokens and run the Random Beacon client, or stake KEEP and bond ETH running the tBTC client. You can also elect to do both.

Work opportunities are awarded randomly, but over time, and the amount of work a delegator is chosen for will be proportional to the amount of KEEP delegated. For example, a person delegating 1,000 KEEP could expect, over time, to be selected for work ten times as often as someone who delegates 100 KEEP, earning fees in proportion to the work they successfully perform.

## Random Beacon Client

### Earnings

If you’re running the random beacon client and staking KEEP, you’ll earn in ETH per each completed transaction. The amount is based on the gas cost to run the relay plus an additional fee (exact amount per relay still under consideration, it will be in the $10-50 USD range). 

### Rewards

In addition to the transaction earnings in ETH, you’ll get a reward in KEEP that's a portion of the KEEP staking subsidy (2% of total KEEP over the course of the distribution period starting June 8th, 2020) for running the beacon.

## tBTC Client (ECDSA Keeps)

### Earnings

If you’re running the tBTC client and staking ETH, every completed transaction is a 6 month term (unless called to redeem earlier). The earnings in the tBTC system start at 5 bps per Bitcoin deposit. 

### Rewards

tBTC stakers with ETH bonded will also earn rewards in KEEP that are a portion of the KEEP staking subsidy (18% of total KEEP over the course of the distribution period, starting June 8th 2020).
