# How to Delegate Stake

This section outlines how to use the Keep Token Dashboard dApp to delegate stake.

## Testnet Token Dashboard Instructions

Prior to launch, you can practice staking with the [Ropsten testnet version](https://dashboard.test.keep.network/) of the token dashboard. You'll need both testnet KEEP and testnet ETH, which you can get from faucets.

The testnet KEEP faucet will issue a 300k KEEP token grant for the provided Ethereum account. Use the faucet in your web browser by adding your Ethereum account on the end of the **faucet endpoint** with the parameter `?account=<eth-account-address>` The faucet endpoint is: [https://us-central1-keep-test-f3e0.cloudfunctions.net/keep-faucet-ropsten](https://us-central1-keep-test-f3e0.cloudfunctions.net/keep-faucet-ropsten)

For example, it would look like this: 

`http://us-central1-keep-test-f3e0.cloudfunctions.net/keep-faucet-ropsten?account=0x0000000000000`

::: warning
**Note that testnet KEEP is not the same as mainnet KEEP**. Be conscious of which wallets you have selected. We recommend having a wallet specifically dedicated to testnet interactions.

## Getting Started

You'll need to have KEEP tokens before being able to stake with the token dashboard. Go to [dashboard.keep.network](http://dashboard.keep.network/) to get started. The first thing you’ll see is a screen prompting you to connect your wallet.

### Connect a Wallet

After you connect your wallet for the first time, you’ll be able to see tokens from a token grant directly in the token dashboard, but you won’t see them immediately in your wallet’s interface. You'll be able to see your tokens in your wallet interface (e.g. a Ledger) after withdrawing available unlocked tokens. Tokens in a grant will unlock according to their unlocking schedule. 

::: tip
It is not necessary to withdraw your tokens from the grant in order to stake. You can also stake locked tokens.

### Token Overview page

You'll now be on the Token Overview page. This is where you’ll see your token balance, broken down into total granted tokens (your token grants) and total owned tokens. Owned tokens are tokens that’ve been unlocked after vesting and are available to withdraw in addition to staking. You’ll also see how many tokens you have delegated, and your delegation and undelegation progress and history.

## Staking Your Tokens via Delegation

Regardless of if you’re staking in-house or staking with a provider, you will start the process off in the same way. For tips and contact information for staking with a provider, check out [this section](/Staking/staking_providers.md).

### How do I stake my tokens?

From the token overview page, click **Delegate Tokens**. You will see that there are two options available, **Grants** and **Owned**. You can choose to delegate from either of these. If you delegate from a grant, you will choose the particular grant from the dropdown menu.

Next, you are prompted to assign addresses to three different roles: authorizer, operator, and beneficiary.

* **Authorizer**: A role that approves operator contracts and slashing rules for operator misbehavior.

* **Operator**: A staking client that has been delegated a stake. Also known as a staker, this could be a client you’re running in-house or it could be a staking provider.

* **Beneficiary**: The address to which rewards are sent that are generated by stake doing work on the network.

As the grantee and token owner, you are considered the **owner**. 

Determine the three addresses for your 3 roles (authorizer, operator, beneficiary) in addition to the amount of tokens you wish to delegate to stake.

Once you've put in all the information, hit the delegate stake button and confirm the transaction in the dialog box and in your external wallet.

### Can I cancel my stake delegation?

You must first wait a designated period for your stake delegation to finish initializing. During this initialization period, you will be able to cancel your delegation.

### How do I undelegate my staked tokens?

In the delegation history table, you can see a record of your delegations. If you wish to undelegate, keep in mind that stake undelegation takes 60 days to complete before those tokens are available to recover to your KEEP token balance. They will show with a pending status on your Token Overview page during this period, and will not appear on the token overview page.

If the tokens were from a token grant, they can be recovered to the grant they were delegated from. If they are owned tokens, they will return to the owned tokens section.

## (tBTC) Bonding ETH for Signer Selection

To participate in tBTC at launch, you’ll need to have KEEP stake delegated to an operator, and then you will have to make ETH available for that operator to bond. This initial bonding will be done via the Token Dashboard dapp.

tBTC uses a bonded ECDSA keep. The end user (the Bitcoin depositor) puts out a request for signers and 3 random signers who have bonded ETH are selected. Then, signers do a key ceremony and generate a pubkey for the Bitcoin deposit. The fee term for each signer set is 6 months, although the Bitcoin can be redeemed sooner. 

For those bonding ETH immediately, you’ll want to either be monitoring manually or set maintainer scripts to make sure you’re getting pinged upon redemption and other calls such as:  

* Call to participate in an ECDSA signer set for a tBTC deposit

* Call to tBTC redemption

* Call warning a tBTC deposit is in danger of undercollateralization

* Call for tBTC deposit liquidation

Being selected for an ECDSA signer set will draw on the available bonds your operators have, and if these dip too low the operators will no longer be eligible for signing, reducing the potential signing fees you can collect.  A redeemed tBTC deposit, on the other hand, will return bonds to your operator's available bonding pool. Finally, a deposit liquidation, which can only be triggered in case of significant BTC-ETH price movement or malicious behavior by your operators, will result in bond seizure and auction. If you provide ETH bonds, watching for these will allow you to manage your ETH bond balance and work to prevent undercollateralization-related bond loss.

The stakedrop will add the ability to stake ETH. This will mean operating a signer without a KEEP stake, solely backed by ETH. These signers will only be able to participate in tBTC's ECDSA keeps, and will receive KEEP over time based on how many deposits they sign for. More information will be available closer to the stakedrop date.
