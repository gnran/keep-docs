The design can be implemented on a smart-contract-enabled host chain that supports custom tokens and a subset of functionality needed to prove certain properties of Bitcoin transactions. This spec in particular assumes the host chain is Ethereum. The peg is implemented using an approach dubbed a bonded, multifederated peg, in which a randomly chosen subset of a larger network of signing nodes is chosen to back individual deposits requested by users wishing to mint TBTC tokens on the host chain. The chosen signers use a threshold ECDSA protocol to generate a Bitcoin wallet without any single signer having access to the corresponding private key, and bond an amount of the host chain’s native token (ETH for Ethereum) that ensures their behavior in the system remains honest, at risk of losing their bond in case of dishonesty or undercollateralization. A smart contract on the host chain mediates the deposit’s lifecycle, including opening deposits, collateralization, signer fraud, and redemption. Redemption allows for a deposit to have its held BTC withdrawn on the Bitcoin chain, and pays signers. Additional mechanisms are described to properly incentivize a fixed term for deposits to ensure signer compensation and to allow signer exit in case of impending undercollateralization.")]),e._v(" "),i("h2",{attrs:{id:"design-goals"}},[i("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#design-goals"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Design Goals")]),e._v(" "),i("p",[e._v('The goal of tBTC is the creation an ERC-20 token that maintains the most important property of Bitcoin- its status as "hard money".')]),e._v(" "),i("p",[e._v('To maintain the "hard money" status of its backing BTC deposits, tBTC must remain')]),e._v(" "),i("ul",[i("li",[i("p",[e._v("Censorship and seizure resistant, across friendly and unfriendly jurisdictions")])]),e._v(" "),i("li",[i("p",[e._v("Inflation-resistant.
